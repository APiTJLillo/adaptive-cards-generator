# Agent Instructions

This repository contains a ServiceNow UI Builder component for designing Adaptive Cards.
The project requires Node.js version 14 or newer.

## Coding Guidelines
- Source code lives primarily in `src/`. Use TypeScript when possible.
- Follow the lint rules defined in `.eslintrc.js`. Naming conventions prefer camelCase for variables and PascalCase for types and classes.
- Prettier formatting is enforced via ESLint, so run a formatter before committing.

## Recommended Checks
- There are currently no automated tests or build scripts. If you add any, document them and ensure they pass (`npm test` etc.).
- When making changes, attempt to run `npx eslint .` to catch style issues.

## Commit Messages
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages summarizing your changes.

## Documentation
- Update `README.md` when you add new features or usage examples.
