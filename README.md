# adaptive-cards-designer-servicenow

Design adaptive cards with a UI Builder component.

This project is meant to be run with the ServiceNow `snc` CLI rather than standard Node commands. The CLI handles building and serving the component inside a ServiceNow instance. Typical Node commands like `npm start` will not work. Ensure the `snc` CLI is installed and configured for your instance.

## Getting Started

1. Install the ServiceNow CLI (`snc`).
2. Run `snc ui-dev` to start a local development server.
3. Use `snc ui-component` commands to manage components.

Node.js 14 or newer is still required for the CLI and development tooling.
